Here we have provided a sample simulation. After building lammps as `lmp`, the simulation can be replicated using:

`lmp -in input.in`

This file takes in init.dat as the initial file and then simulates effective acetylation for 200000 simulation steps. The subsequent analysis has been performed in `test_analysis.ipynb` to show the evolution of the polymer in time.
